# AnimalRFIDTagReader

Reader for ISO11784/11785 134.2 kHz RFID tags as used in animal tracking and identification tags.

The code is for an ESP32 development board due to its small size and second hardware serial port but should also work with an Arduino Mega 2560 or similar.
To display the read information, a 0.66in OLED display with 64x48 pixel is used.
